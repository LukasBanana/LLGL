\brief Command queue interface.
\remarks This class is mainly used for modern rendering APIs (such as Direct3D 12 and Vulkan)
to submit one ore more command buffers (or command lists) into the command queue.
For older rendering APIs (such as Direct3D 11 and OpenGL) submitting a command buffer has no effect.
It also provides the functionality to submit small sized objects such as fences into the command queue.

        /* ----- Queries ----- */

        /**
        \brief Retrieves the result of the specified query objects.
        \param[in] queryHeap Specifies the query heap.
        \param[in] firstQuery Specifies the zero-based index of the first query within the heap.
        This must be in the half-open range [0, QueryHeapDescriptor::numQueries).
        \param[in] numQueries Specifies the number of queries to retrieve the result from.
        This must be less than or equal to (QueryHeapDescriptor::numQueries - firstQuery) and it must not be zero.
        \param[out] data Specifies the pointer to the output data. This must be a valid pointer to an array of \c numQueries entries.
        The array entries must have one of the following types:
        - std::uint32_t
        - std::uint64_t
        - QueryPipelineStatistics
        If the function return false, the content of this array is undefined.
        \param[in] dataSize Specifies the size (in bytes) of the output data.
        This must be equal to <code>numQueries * sizeof(T)</code> where \c T is the type of the query entries described above.
        \return True, if all results are available. Otherwise, the results are (partially) unavailable and the content of the output data is undefined.
        \remarks Here is a usage example:
        \code
        // Get results of 10 occlusion queries
        std::uint64_t occlusionQueryResults[10] = {};
        myCmdQueue->QueryResult(*myOcclusionQuery, 0, 10, occlusionQueryResults, sizeof(occlusionQueryResults));

        Waiting for the queue to be become idle is equivalent to submitting a fence and waiting for that fence to be signaled:
