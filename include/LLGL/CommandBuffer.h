/**
\brief Command buffer interface used for storing and encoding GPU commands.

\remarks This is the main interface to encode graphics, compute, and blit commands to be submitted to the GPU.
All states that can be changed with a setter function are not persistent across several encoding sections.
Before any command can be encoded, the command buffer must be set into encode mode, which is done by the CommandBuffer::Begin function.

\remarks In a multi-threaded environment, all blit commands (e.g. CommandBuffer::UpdateBuffer, CommandBuffer::CopyBuffer etc.) <b>must not</b> be called simultaneously
with the same source and/or destination resources even if their ranges do not collide.
Depending on the backend, those resources might be transitioned into different states during those commands.
The same applies to CommandBuffer::BeginRenderPass where the specified RenderTarget might be transitioned into rendering state.
Binding resources (CommandBuffer::SetResource, CommandBuffer::SetResourceHeap) as well as vertex (CommandBuffer::SetVertexBuffer) and
index streams (CommandBuffer::SetIndexBuffer) can be performed in a multi-threaded fashion with either the same or separate resources.

        /**
        \brief Begins with a new render pass.

        \param[in] renderTarget Specifies the render target in which the subsequent draw operations will be stored.
        If this is a swap-chain and SwapChain::Present is called on such swap-chain before this command buffer is submitted to the command queue,
        use \c swapBufferIndex parameter to render into a specific swap buffer and then select the correct command buffer
        via SwapChain::GetCurrentSwapIndex when submitting to the command queue.

        \param[in] renderPass Specifies an optional render pass object. If this is null, the default render pass for the specified render target will be used.
        This render pass object must be compatible with the render pass object the specified render target was created with.
        Note that the default render pass will ignore the previous framebuffer content (see AttachmentLoadOp::Undefined), i.e. such a render pass section should fill the entire framebuffer.

        \param[in] numClearValues Specifies the number of clear values that are specified in the \c clearValues parameter.
        This \em should be greater than or equal to the number of render pass attachments whose load operation (i.e. AttachmentFormatDescriptor::loadOp) is set to AttachmentLoadOp::Clear.
        Otherwise, the following default values are used: (0, 0, 0, 0) for color, 1 for depth, 0 for stencil.

        \param[in] clearValues Optional pointer to the array of clear values.
        If \c numClearValues is not zero, this must be a valid pointer to an array of at least \c numClearValues entries.
        Each entry in the array is used to clear the attachment whose load operation is set to AttachmentLoadOp::Clear,
        where the depth attachment (i.e. RenderPassDescriptor::depthAttachment) and
        the stencil attachment (i.e. RenderPassDescriptor::stencilAttachment) are combined and appear as the last entry.

        \param[in] swapBufferIndex Optional index into what swap-chain buffer the render pass is meant to be rendered.
        If this is equal to \c LLGL_CURRENT_SWAP_INDEX, the current buffer in the swap-chain is used.
        Otherwise, this should be the current value returned by SwapChain::GetCurrentSwapIndex.
        This parameter is ignored for regular render targets, i.e. if \c renderTarget is \e not a SwapChain.

        \remarks This function starts a new render pass section and must be ended with the \c EndRenderPass function.
        Render passes must not be interleaved, i.e. each render pass must end before a new render pass can begin.

        \remarks The following example shows how to use a render pass to clear a render target with two color attachments and a depth-stencil attachment:
        \code
        LLGL::ClearValue myClearValues[3];

        // Set clear values for color attachments 0 and 1
        myClearValues[0].color = { 1, 0, 0, 1 };
        myClearValues[1].color = { 0, 1, 0, 1 };

        // Set clear values for depth-stencil attachment
        myClearValues[2].depth   = 1.0f;
        myClearValues[2].stencil = 0;

        // Begin render pass and clear render target
        myCmdBuffer->BeginRenderPass(*myRenderTarget, *myRenderPass, 3, myClearValues);
        {
            // Draw scene ...
        }
        myCmdBuffer->EndRenderPass();
        \endcode

        \remarks
        The following commands \b must only be used \b inside a render pass section:
        - Drawing commands (i.e. \c Draw, \c DrawInstanced, \c DrawIndexed, \c DrawIndexedInstanced, \c DrawIndirect and \c DrawIndexedIndirect).
        - Clear attachment commands (i.e. \c Clear and \c ClearAttachments).
        - Query block (i.e. \c BeginQuery and \c EndQuery).
        - Conditional render block (i.e. \c BeginRenderCondition and \c EndRenderCondition).
        - Stream-output block (i.e. \c BeginStreamOutput and \c EndStreamOutput).

        \remarks
        The following commands \b must only be used \b outside a render pass section:
        - Dispatch compute commands (i.e. \c Dispatch and \c DispatchIndirect).

        \remarks
        The following commands \em can be used both inside and outside a render pass section but are \em recommended
        to be used only \b outside a render pass section to avoid potential performace penalties:
        - Copy commands (i.e. \c UpdateBuffer, \c CopyBuffer*, and \c CopyTexture*).
        - MIP-map generation commands (i.e. \c GenerateMips).
