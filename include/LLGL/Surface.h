\brief The Surface interface is the base interface for Window (on Desktop platforms) and Canvas (on mobile platforms).
\remarks Surface provides the minimal required interface for a graphics rendering context,
such as the access to the native handle, information about the content size (i.e. the client area size),
and the ability to adapt for a new video mode or an updated pixel format
(which is required for multi-sampled framebuffers on a WGL context for instance).
